# Feedback on Final

I thinkg you did a good job with your final project. Just a few notes:
1. Using functions is helpful to organizing code, making things testable and repeatable, and making code more reusable. Your project only had one function definition.
2. You provide a good intro and conclusion. More explanation along the way would have been helpful.
