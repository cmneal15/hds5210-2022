# Notes on the Midterm

* _Correctness    (out of 40):_ 39
* _Good Practices (out of 10):_ 9
* _Docs / Testing (out of 10):_ 1

_Details on the grading criteria for the midterm can be found on [Canvas](https://canvas.slu.edu/courses/28045/rubrics/23671)._

You did not include docstring comments and tests as instructed. You do have some useful comments in your code, so I've only deducted 9 points from the _Docs / Testing_ section.

## Step 1
* Rather the opening and reading in the file in a previous cell, your function needed to do this part itself using the `file` parameter as the file name. I've deducted 1 point from _Correctness_ for this.

## Step 2
* This can work more simply by doing all the tests in a single pass through the data. See my solution presented in class for an example of that.

## Step 3
* I like how you separated out the `charge_rate()` function to isolate that logic. Works very nicely.

## Step 4
* You had a pretty good solution here except for some confusion at the beginning because you did some work of reading data in in previous cells. Because of this confusion created by reading data in previous cells on a couple of parts, I've deducted 1 point from _Good Practices_.
